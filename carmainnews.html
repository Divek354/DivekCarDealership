    <h1>Our other Collabs</h1>
  <p>
  In a year filled with brand collaborations, auto brands delivered some of the coolest, 
  if not the most inventive.
Straying from traditional partnerships including luxury brands, BMW,
 Porsche, Lamborghini, and Divek’s Car Manufacturer company experimented
  to reach younger car buyers and audiences who will eventually be old 
  enough to purchase cars. For Tesla and Aston Martin, liquor collaborations
   were a unique option. Meanwhile, Hyundai is testing the waters with
    sustainable fashion and a series of Spotify podcasts and playlists.
The collabs showcase these car brands’ efforts to delve deeper into the
 direct-to-consumer category, a strategy in response to the pandemic
  temporarily closing dealerships in March and April collabs of the year
In October, Divek’s Car Manufacturer company partnered with streetwear
 retailer Kith to sell a 94-piece clothing and accessories line along
  with vintage BMW M3s. These modified automobiles were sold online but
   were distributed through BMW dealerships. Within a day, they were sold 
   out across Europe, Japan and U.S. markets, ringing up more than $16 million.
It was 94-piece clothing and accessory largest partnership in the streetwear
 category to date, says Divek, head of brand communications and strategy for
  94-piece clothing and accessorie, who adds that streetwear is becoming high
   fashion again, as it was in the 90s. That trend works perfectly for the company.
